## Introduction

The IoT analytical life cycle expands traditional analysis processing beyond investigation of stored data (i.e., at rest) to analytical investigation of streaming data (i.e., in motion) or at the edge. The combined capability of data management, streaming analytics execution, and intelligent decisioning enables fast and confident decision making from data, to discovery, to deployment.

SAS Analytics for IoT offers an optimized IoT solution ecosystem and addresses the entire analytical life cycle.


In this [document](doc/Deploy_ASTORE_from_SAS_Model_Manager_in_SAS_Event_Stream_Processing.pdf) we are focusing on the integrated process of model management and analytics deployment.

## Key take-aways:

- Learn how to import ASTORE from models built in SAS Model Studio, SAS Studio, or Jupyter Notebook into SAS Model Manager
- Learn how to deploy ASTORE from SAS Model Manager in SAS Event Stream Processing Studio
